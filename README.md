# Ch 3: Which has a greater impact on coral resilience to marine heatwaves, reef of origin or exposure to naturally fluctuating temperatures?

Reciprocal transplant experiment using *Pseudodiploria strigosa* originating from MacArthur Causeway North (Port of Miami region) and Emerald Reef.

**Hypothesis**: Corals originating from the naturally variable inshore Port of Miami region will have significantly different gene expression profiles than the offshore-native corals, and this will translate to increased survivorship and less bleaching during marine heatwaves.

**Methods**: 
- Three distinct colonies of *P. strigosa* were collected from Star Island and two distinct colonies were collected from Emerald Reef on December 6, 2022. All colonies were fragmented in approximately 5cm^2 fragments. Colonies 1, 2, and 3 were collected from MacN and fragmented into 12 pieces. 6 of each were randomly selected to be outplanted to Emerald, and the rest were outplanted back to MacN. Colonies 4 an 5 were collected from Emerald. Colony 4 was fragmented into 12 pieces, but colony 5 generated 24 pieces. 6 and 12 were outplanted to MacN and Emerald, respectively (and vice versa). 
- Tissue samples were taken at the time of fragmentation (N=54). At six months post-outplanting, tissue samples of all remaining alive fragments (N=44) were collected on July 11. At this time point, fragments at MacN were 100% bleached, while fragments at Emerald were pale. 
- Several instruments were deployed during this experiment to collect environmental data: SeaFETs for pH, ecoPARs for light irradiation, tiltmeters for current speed and direction, CTDs for temperature and depth, and STRs for temperature. SeaFETs, ecoPARs, and CTDs were swapped every 2-3 months to download data and recalibrate instruments. Water samples were taken at time of SeaFET deployment to calibrate carbonate chemistry measurements.

**Current progress**: DNA and RNA extractions need to occur this fall and RNA needs to be sent for sequencing. Number of samples and time points will depend on sequencing contract and number of prep kits available. Potential for qPCR of actin loci for symbiont genera typing to be conducted as well.
